## Workflow Summary
1. **Data Preparation**: Use utility functions to load and preprocess earthquake and eruption data.
2. **Exploration**: Visualize spatial, temporal, and magnitude distributions in `Data Exploration.ipynb`.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Add features such as earthquake rates, time to/since eruption, and select East Rift Zone events.
4. **ML Modeling**:
   - **Random Forests**: Classification and regression in `Random_forest.ipynb`.
   - **Logistic Regression & Clustering**: In `RunMLTests.ipynb`, compare classifiers and use K-Means for unsupervised analysis.

5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC AUC, R2) and visualizations to assess model performance.
6. **Reproducibility**: Index files (`train.txt`, `dev.txt`, `test.txt`) ensure consistent splits for experiments.

## Dataset Details
- **PuuOo.csv**: Eruption events, with timing and physical parameters.
- **puuoo_earthquakes.csv**: Earthquake events, with location, depth, magnitude, and type.
- **KilaueaHypocentersANSS.csv**: Broader catalog for Kilauea region.

## How to Use
1. Open any notebook in Jupyter and follow the workflow cells.
2. Use utility functions from `util/` for data loading and feature engineering.
3. Modify index files to change train/val/test splits if needed.
4. Generated plots are saved as PNGs for further analysis or publication.
