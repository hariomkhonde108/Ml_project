# Kilauea Eruption Prediction: Machine Learning Analysis

## üåã Overview

This repository hosts the code and analysis for the **UE23CS352A Machine Learning Mini-Project**. The project applies various machine learning algorithms to historical earthquake data from Kilauea Volcano (specifically the East Rift Zone and Pu'u '≈å'≈ç crater) to predict its eruptive state.

The methodology is based on the research paper, *"Predicting Eruptive Events at Volcanoes from Earthquake Data"*. The primary hypothesis is that **engineered earthquake rate features** can capture the increased seismic unrest that precedes a volcanic eruption.

## üéØ Problem Statement

The goal is to test the predictive capabilities of the Kilauea earthquake catalog by solving two distinct machine learning tasks:

1. **Contemporaneous Eruption Classification:** A binary classification task to predict if the volcano is currently erupting (1) or in a repose period (0) at the time of an earthquake.

2. **Time to Eruption Regression (Forecasting):** A regression task to forecast the continuous time (in scaled units) until the next eruption commences.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To set up the environment and run the analysis notebooks, follow these steps:

### Windows PowerShell

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/hariomkhonde108/Ml_project.git
   cd Ml_project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Linux/macOS

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hariomkhonde108/Ml_project.git
   cd Ml_project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

*The notebooks should be executed in sequential order starting with data exploration and feature engineering.*

## üìä Results and Performance

All models were evaluated using a stratified **70% Train / 20% Development / 10% Test split**.

### 1. Classification Task Performance

Due to significant **class imbalance** (~80% Repose labels), performance was measured using **Cohen's Kappa (Œ∫)** (agreement beyond chance) and **AUROC** (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve).

| Algorithm | Dataset | Kappa (Œ∫) | AUROC |
|:----------|:--------|:----------|:------|
| **Random Forest** | **Test** | **0.52** | **0.71** |
| Logistic Regression | Test | 0.28 | 0.60 |
| K-Means | Test | 0.24 | 0.63 |
| Neural Network | Test | 0.29 | 0.61 |

**Conclusion:** The **Random Forest** was the best classifier, demonstrating **moderate agreement** (Œ∫=0.52) and strong discriminatory power (AUROC=0.71).

### 2. Regression Task Performance

Performance for the Time-to-Eruption task was assessed using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and the **R¬≤ value** (coefficient of determination).

| Algorithm | RMSE (Train/Dev/Test) | R¬≤ (Train/Dev/Test) |
|:----------|:---------------------|:--------------------|
| **Random Forest** | 0.16 / 0.68 / **0.64** | 0.82 / 0.37 / **0.38** |
| Neural Network | 0.86 / 0.92 / 0.90 | 0.26 / 0.15 / 0.19 |
| K-Means | 0.95 / 0.95 / 1.02 | 0.097 / 0.059 / 0.037 |

**Conclusion:** The Random Forest again performed best, but the **R¬≤ value of 0.38** indicates a **weak correlation** between predicted and observed times to eruption.

### 3. Feature Importance

For the Random Forest Regression model, the most important features were:

1. **Monthly Rate** (Earthquake count over 30 days)
2. **Weekly Rate** (Earthquake count over 7 days)
3. **Latitude (Y coordinate)**

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow and Files

The project follows a sequential workflow across its key notebooks:

| File/Folder | Purpose |
|:------------|:--------|
| `KilaueaHypocentersANSS.csv` | **Raw Data:** The primary earthquake catalog input |
| `kilauea_eruptionHistory.xlsx - Eruptions.csv` | **Label Data:** Provides eruption start/end times for label generation |
| `PuuOo.csv` | Auxiliary data related to the specific vent |
| `kilauea_eruptionHistory.xlsx - Intrusions.csv` | Magma intrusion data |
| `dev.txt` | The **development (validation) set** used for hyperparameter tuning |
| **`Data Exploration.ipynb`** | Initial cleaning, visualization, and spatial filtering to the East Rift Zone |
| **`AddFeaturesToEQs.ipynb`** | **Feature Engineering:** Calculates the time-to-eruption label and derives earthquake rate features (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) |
| **`EQrates.ipynb`** | **Data Processing:** Finalizes features, scales the data, and prepares the train/dev/test sets |
| **`DEEP PEEVED.ipynb`** (or `DEEP.ipynb`) | Implementation and training of the **Neural Network** and consolidated testing of all models |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

### Execution Order

To reproduce the project results, follow the notebooks sequentially:

1. **Data Preparation and Exploration:** Run `Data Exploration.ipynb` to load, clean, and spatially filter the earthquake and eruption data.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Execute `AddFeaturesToEQs.ipynb` and `EQrates.ipynb` to:
   - Calculate **earthquake rates** (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
   - Generate the **Time-to-Eruption label**
   - Perform feature **scaling** (standardization)

3. **Model Training and Tuning:** Utilize the remaining notebooks to:
   - Train and tune all four models: Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering, Random Forest, and Neural Network
   - Tune hyperparameters (e.g., Random Forest Max Depth) using the **development set**

4. **Final Evaluation:** Evaluate the models on the unseen **test set** using appropriate metrics (Œ∫, AUROC, RMSE, R¬≤)
