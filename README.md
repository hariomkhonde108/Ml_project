# Machine Learning Project - Solubility Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the solubility (logS) of chemical compounds using machine learning. By leveraging molecular descriptors and regression models, the project aims to offer insights into compound solubility for research and development purposes.

## Features
- Loads and processes a dataset directly from a GitHub repository.
- Prepares data for model training with proper cleaning and formatting.
- Splits data into training and testing sets.
- Implements regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) for predictions.
- Visualizes predicted results against experimental values.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (for interactive development)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ml-solubility-prediction.git
   cd ml-solubility-prediction
   ```
2. Install the necessary packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
- To run the model training script locally, execute:
  ```bash
  python train_model.py
  ```
- Alternatively, run the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab for an interactive experience.
